# CODTECH Internship - Task 1: Cloud Storage Setup

This project simulates the setup of a cloud storage bucket as required by the CODTECH internship task.

## Instructions Followed:

1. Simulated the creation of a cloud storage bucket.
2. Uploaded a sample file (`example.txt`) to the simulated bucket.
3. Configured access permissions (`permissions.txt`).

## Deliverables:
- A folder representing a cloud bucket with example file uploads.
- Simulated access permissions configuration.
- Placeholder for screenshots.

## Note:
Due to the inability to access AWS/GCP without a debit card, this setup is a local simulation.
